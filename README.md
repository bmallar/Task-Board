# task-board

To start I added a modal in HTML off of bootstrap. I set my id's and added what text I wanted and thats all that needed to be done.

NO CSS changes.

I didn't finsih this completly but the due time is friday at midnight, so im cutting my loses here, and finshing this over the weekened. But I will explain what I got done.

I only have one local storage get item which I used Json parse. Then im saying grab me this list or give me an empty array.

Then I made a for loop to add the full array to the console and then underneath is to add what is written and then append is to put it on the page.

after that I have my modal javascript then i rewrote the .vals to make the text from previous entries. made it into an object so i could stringify it then i send the fuction.

The delete and drag/drop are not in use yet

datepicker function from jquery

Lastly is how i add the modal entries
